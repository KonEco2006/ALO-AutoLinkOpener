# ALO-AutoLinkOpener
These days, many people(mostly students) attend meetings almost every day and sometimes they are late, because they are looking for the links. Â  ALO(Auto Link Opener) was designed to solve this problem. It is an application that can automatically attend your meetings, open your e-mails and do every other task that can be done by opening a link. The only thing that you have to do, is to insert the links, the day and the time you want to open them, and the program is going to open the links on the day and time you have inserted, automatically, for as many weeks you want.
